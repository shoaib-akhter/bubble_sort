# bubble_sort

This Ruby script implements the **Bubble Sort algorithm**, which repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order until the array is sorted. It includes an **early exit optimization** to stop when no swaps occur, improving efficiency.

## Usage
Call `bubble_sort` with an array of numbers, and it will return the sorted array.

## Example
```ruby
bubble_sort([4, 3, 78, 2, 0, 2])
# Expected Output: [0, 2, 2, 3, 4, 78]
```
